1. i’m a computer science student (linux and neovim, btw).

computer science is something i’m genuinely passionate about—if it weren’t my profession, i’d still spend my free time programming and exploring new topics just for fun.
one thing i love is challenging myself by building projects in languages i know nothing about (like these: [advent of code 2024 in gleam](https://github.com/dabzr/AoC-2024.git) and [sat solver in rust](https://github.com/dabzr/saturno.git)).

within computer science, a few areas really stand out to me:  
- logic  
- functional programming  
- high-performance programming  
- operating systems  

and there’s plenty more i’m eager to dive into.

2. i also love music! and i (try to) play guitar.

there isn't a specific genre i listen to the most — what i like really varies depending on my vibe at the time.
one habit that kinda proves that is that i make semiannual playlists (sometimes quarterly ones), where i try not to repeat songs from the last playlist and pick tracks that feel like they define me during that period.

but if i had to choose one artist today, it would be mr. bob dylan.but if i have choose an artist today that would be mr. bob dylan

3. FIGHTING GAMES! recently i acquired the hobby to play fighting games (mainly street fighter) and is something that im loving.
