1. i’m a computer science student (linux and neovim, btw).

computer science is something i’m genuinely passionate about—if it weren’t my profession, i’d still spend my free time programming and exploring new topics just for fun.
one thing i love is challenging myself by building projects in languages i know nothing about (like these: [advent of code 2024 in gleam](https://github.com/dabzr/AoC-2024.git) and [sat solver in rust](https://github.com/dabzr/saturno.git)).

within computer science, a few areas really stand out to me:  
- logic  
- functional programming  
- high-performance programming  
- operating systems  

and there’s plenty more i’m eager to dive into.

here's my workspace!

2. i also love music! and i (try to) play guitar.

there's not a specific genre that i listen the most, and what i like to listen varies from my vibe at the time.
a habit that i have that proves that statement is that i have a six-month playlists (some times three-month playlists) that i try to not repeat songs of the 
last playlist and try to use songs that define me the most in that period of time.

but if i have choose an artist today that would be mr. bob dylan

3. FIGHTING GAMES! recently i acquired the hobby to play fighting games (mainly street fighter) and is something that im loving.
