# Welcome!!
This blog is an attempt to write about things that i have interest and to use the internet in a different way that is generally used nowadays.
Here i'll have a main language (english) and a second language (portuguese), sometimes i'll post in one and sometimes in another (sorry).

Here i'll probably write about computer science, personal thoughts, music, cinema and >maybe< some poems and chronicles.

If you are somewhat interested in my person read about me in the "about" page.

If you are not interested in me (╥﹏╥) and just want to read my posts then you should click in the "posts" page.
